## API Endpoints Created

### Order Management:
- `GET /api/orders/` - List user's orders (paginated)
- `GET /api/orders/{id}/` - Retrieve specific order details
- `POST /api/orders/create_order/` - Create order from current cart
- `POST /api/orders/{id}/cancel/` - Cancel order (if allowed)
- `GET /api/orders/stats/` - Get order statistics
- `GET /api/orders/info/` - API information

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Order Creation from Cart
- Atomic transaction to prevent race conditions
- Stock validation and reduction
- Cart clearing after successful order
- Support for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Contact info from user profile or request data

### 2. Order Management
- Unique order numbers (OG-YYYYMMDD-00001 format)
- Status tracking (pending, paid, processing, shipped, delivered, canceled)
- Payment method support (cod, click, payme, card, none)
- Order cancellation with status validation

### 3. Security & Permissions
- User-based order access (authenticated users see only their orders)
- Session-based access for anonymous users
- Object-level permissions for order operations

### 4. Admin Interface
- Professional order management with inlines
- Order item snapshots (prevents data loss if products deleted)
- Search, filtering, and bulk operations
- Status badges and customer information display

### 5. Testing
- Comprehensive pytest test suite covering:
  - Anonymous and authenticated order creation
  - Stock validation and reduction
  - Order access permissions
  - Order cancellation rules
  - Order number generation
  - Statistics endpoint

## Database Design

### Order Model Features:
- UUID primary key for security
- Sequential order numbers per day
- User or session_key for ownership
- Contact info snapshot (prevents data loss)
- Financial totals with decimal precision
- Proper indexing for performance

### OrderItem Model Features:
- Product snapshot to preserve order history
- Quantity, price, and sale price tracking
- Reference to original product (nullable for deleted products)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup:
```bash
# Migrations were already created and run
python manage.py makemigrations order  # Already done
python manage.py migrate  # Already done
```

### 2. Settings Configuration:
```python
# Already added to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps ...
    'apps.order',  # Already present
]

# Optional: Add custom user model (not implemented to avoid breaking existing data)
# AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'  # Uncomment if starting fresh
```

### 3. URL Configuration:
```python
# Already added to api/urls.py:
urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    path('', include('apps.order.urls')),  # Already added
]
```

### 4. Default Avatar Setup:
```bash
# Create media directory for avatars:
mkdir -p media/avatars/
# Add default.png file to media/avatars/ directory
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Anonymous User Order Creation:
```javascript
// Step 1: Add items to cart
fetch('/api/cart/add_item/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ product_id: 'uuid', quantity: 2 })
});

// Step 2: Create order
fetch('/api/orders/create_order/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        full_name: 'John Doe',
        contact_phone: '+998901112233',
        delivery_address: 'Tashkent, Chilonzor',
        payment_method: 'cod'
    })
});
```

### 2. Authenticated User Order Creation:
```javascript
// If user has profile data (first_name, last_name, phone), only address required:
fetch('/api/orders/create_order/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        delivery_address: 'Samarkand, Registon street',
        payment_method: 'click'
    })
});
```

### 3. Order Management:
```javascript
// List orders
fetch('/api/orders/');

// Get order details  
fetch('/api/orders/{order_id}/');

// Cancel order
fetch('/api/orders/{order_id}/cancel/', { method: 'POST' });

// Get statistics
fetch('/api/orders/stats/');
```

## Error Handling

### Stock Validation:
- Prevents order creation if insufficient stock
- Returns specific product names and available quantities

### Permission Validation:
- Users can only access their own orders
- Anonymous users match by session key
- Proper 403/404 responses for unauthorized access

### Order Status Validation:
- Only pending/processing orders can be cancelled
- Clear error messages for invalid operations

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Queries:
- `select_related()` for user and product relationships
- `prefetch_related()` for order items
- Proper database indexes on frequently queried fields

### Race Condition Prevention:
- `select_for_update()` for stock validation
- Atomic transactions for order creation
- Sequential order number generation with locking

## Testing

### Run Tests:
```bash
# Run order-specific tests
pytest apps/order/tests/test_orders.py -v

# Run all tests
pytest
```

### Test Coverage:
- Anonymous order creation ✓
- Authenticated order creation ✓
- Stock validation ✓
- Permission checks ✓
- Order cancellation ✓
- Statistics endpoint ✓
- Order number generation ✓

## Production Considerations

### 1. Media Files:
- Configure proper media serving for avatar uploads
- Add default avatar image file

### 2. Background Tasks:
- Consider background tasks for order processing
- Email notifications for order status changes

### 3. Payment Integration:
- Integrate with actual payment providers (Click, Payme)
- Add payment status tracking

### 4. Monitoring:
- Add logging for order creation and status changes
- Monitor order conversion rates and cart abandonment

## Custom User Model (Optional)

If starting a fresh project, you can enable the custom user model:

1. Add to settings.py:
```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'
```

2. Add to INSTALLED_APPS:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing apps ...
    'accounts',
]
```

3. Create and run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py migrate
```

Note: This is not implemented in the current setup to avoid breaking existing user data.
